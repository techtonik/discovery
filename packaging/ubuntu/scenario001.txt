---[Scenario 001]---

It is simple.

There is an outdated version of pyftpdlib on Ubuntu and
I need to get a newer version.


---[Terminology]---

This may be different from official:

*sources*          - archive of pyftpdlib source code
*source archive*   - same as *sources*
*upstream source*  - same as *source archive*

*source package*   - archive with pyftpdlib source and data
                     specific for Ubuntu (patches, scripts, etc.)
*binary package*   - thing that you install (ends with .deb)

*binary package source*   - same as *source package*
*source package source*   - Ubuntu specific data from unpacked
                            *source package*
                            

---[Process]--

[ ] get *source package*
[ ] unpack *source package source*
[ ] update version
[ ] upload new *source package*

The good news about Ubuntu that you don't need to build binary
package - Ubuntu does this automatically. You just need to
upload source package to a special place called Ubuntu PPA.

--- [ ] get *source package* ---

I lied to you. *source package* is not a single archive - it
is three archives. You need:

    python-pyftpdlib_0.7.0-1.dsc
    python-pyftpdlib_0.7.0-1.debian.tar.gz
    python-pyftpdlib_0.7.0.orig.tar.gz

`python-pyftpdlib` is Ubuntu name to for `pyftpdlib` name from
PyPI, so you need to to know how your Python package is named.

    .orig.tar.gz    - is renamed *upstream source*
    .debian.tar.gz  - patches and package specific data
    .dsc            - signed package desciption

--- [ ] unpack *source package source* ---

Just unpack .debia.tar.gz, you will get debian/ directory.
Ubuntu uses debian packages, so don't be surprised.

--- [ ] update version ---

Open debian/changelog and add new version info (yes, they use
changelog for that). Copy-paste last entry and update it:


    python-pyftpdlib (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

      * New upstream release.

     -- Janos Guljas <janos@resenje.org>  Thu, 26 Jan 2012 04:02:09 +0100


This can be made a template:


    @ubuntu-name@ (@version@-1) unstable; urgency=low

      * New upstream release.

     -- @author-email@  @date@


Version field has an obligatory "-1" suffix, which is a
version of the package (not to be confused with version of
pyftpdlib). You may need new package version for the same
version of software when you need to fix typo in changelog,
for example.

Where date is "day-of-week, dd month yyyy hh:mm:ss +zzzz".

--- [ ] upload new *source package* ---

[ ] it seems that this step is only possible on Ubuntu
---
[ ] pack debian/ dir into .tar.gz
  [ ] read version number from debian/changelog
  [ ] @ubuntu-name@_@ubuntu-version@.debian.tar.gz
[ ] ??? WIP


---[Ideally]---

[ ] single file @ubuntu-name@_@ubuntu-version@.ubuntu.tar.gz
[ ] all necessary files in the root directory
  [ ] README(.md)? is obligatory
    [ ] contains entry level descriptions of files and how
        to use them
