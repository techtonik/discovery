gratipay.xml is a an example of Gadget for Blogger. To add it, go to
you blog overview, then:

    Layout -> Add a Gadget -> Add your own

Enter URL (don't add 'https://' prefix or it won't work):

    bitbucket.org/techtonik/discovery/raw/73f57e4804a8c37bf07492df51c9447711f7347a/web/gadgets/gratipay.xml

Set your "Name on Gratipay" and that's it. Blogger preview is somewhat
buggy, so don't rely on it if widget doesn't render correctly - check
the actual page - it should work there.
