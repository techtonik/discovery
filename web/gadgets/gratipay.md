gratipay.xml is a an example of Gadget for Blogger. To add it, go to
you blog overview, then:

    Layout -> Add a Gadget -> Add your own

Enter URL (don't add 'https://' prefix or it won't work):

    bitbucket.org/techtonik/discovery/raw/de3e5a605c1091bd84da3df033e29fa5731fce3e/web/gadgets/gratipay.xml

Set your "Name on Gratipay" (widget type if you want) and view how
it looks on your blog page. Blogger preview didn't work correctly
for me, so don't pay attention to it.
