gratipay.xml is a an example of Gadget for Blogger. To add it, go to
you blog overview, then:

    Layout -> Add a Gadget -> Add your own

Enter URL (don't add 'https://' prefix or it won't work):

    bitbucket.org/techtonik/discovery/raw/cb55f624cea4af4d6ee60d3268c6ddddaf8c4b82/web/gadgets/gratipay.xml

It will show how much I am giving out on Gratipay, because Gadget has
my name hardcoded. You need to change it and reupload your gadget
somewhere to make it useful for your own blog. I may be able to make
this configurable.
