Wrapping command line programs with Python

`twine upload` is an alternative to `setup.py` for uploading
packages to PyPI. I wanted to extend `twine` with `twine source`
command that will checkout source using Git or HG automatically.

    $ twine source https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/python-wget/
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/techtonik/python-wget python-wget
