ID: 001 MISSINGMOL2NAM
Title: Replacement for MOL2NAM
Description:
  Andrew's program MOL2NAM was lost, and the
  laboratory needs a replacement to test its
  warper prototypes.
Task:
  Create a set of cross-platform programs
  to be used instead of MOL2NAM, and place
  them into "dataset" subdir.
Subtasks:
  002 ROTTENMOL
Comments:
  The programs should be platform specific
  binary executables, and the toolchain to
  produce them must be cross-platform as
  well. Go looks like a valid tool.
